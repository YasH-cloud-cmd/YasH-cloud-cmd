##  About Me

I'm a hardware enthusiast who enjoys solving real-world problems with custom PCBs and embedded systems.

I currently work as a **freelance PCB designer**, and I'm also building **FilamentXyash** – a personal venture to design a cost-effective desktop filament extruder for 3D printing.

Whether it's debugging circuits at 1 AM or optimizing board layouts for real-world deployment, I'm passionate about building things that actually work – and keep working.
